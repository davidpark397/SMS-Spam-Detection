# SMS-Spam-Detection
The data I will be using for this analysis project consists of tagged messages that have been collected for SMS spam research originally by researchers at UC Irvine. The dataset contains 5574 english SMS messages, which I will attempt to classify as spam or not spam by first cleaning, processing, and eventually modeling with various classification methods. This project is mainly for improving my understanding of preprocessing methods for text data (tokens, vectorizers, etc.) in addition to some classification techniques commonly used when working with NLP problems (Naive Bayes and KNN).

More detailed information on the dataset including how the dataset was assembled can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection.
